## Install and deploy
To install or deploy, clone this repo and use the `deploy.sh` script.

To run _locally_:
```bash
deploy.sh local
```
To deploy to _development_ staging area:
```bash
deploy.sh dev
```
To deploy to _production_:
```bash
deploy.sh prod
```
Note that [willcarh.art](http://willcarh.art) encrypts its secrets in a GPG file, so you'll have to replicate those values with your own if you'd like to run the app locally.

## Utilities
The following are custom utilities I've written in Python to facilitate the microservices of willcarh.art.

### `Scribe`
The `scribe` writes content to the database from a JSON file. Checkout the code --> [`scribe.py`](https://github.com/wcarhart/willcarh.art/blob/master/scribe.py)

**Usage**:
```bash
# read from default file 'contents.json'
$ python3 scribe.py
# read from custom file 'custom.json'
$ python3 scribe.py -f custom.json
```
### `Herald`
The `herald` sends emails. Checkout the code --> [`herald.py`](https://github.com/wcarhart/willcarh.art/blob/master/herald.py)

**Usage**:
```bash
# send an email with the subject "News Flash!" to "you@email.com" describing the news
$ python3 herald.py -s "News Flash!" -t "you@email.com" "willcarh.art is a sick website!"
```
### `Locksmith`
The `locksmith` encrypts project secrets so nefarious individuals can't see them when my code's stored in GitHub. Checkout the code --> [`locksmith`](https://github.com/wcarhart/locksmith)

**Usage**:
See linked repository: [`locksmith`](https://github.com/wcarhart/locksmith)
### `Maid`
The `maid` cleans and refreshes the database for updates. Checkout the code --> [`maid.py`](https://github.com/wcarhart/willcarh.art/blob/master/maid.py)

**Usage**:
```bash
# clean the database
$ python3 maid.py
# clean the database and update using Scribe
$ python3 maid.py -u
```
### `Chronicler`
The `chronicler` updates, records, and manages the app's manifest file (which contains version, etc.). Checkout the code --> [`chronicler.py`](https://github.com/wcarhart/willcarh.art/blob/master/chronicler.py)

**Usage**:
```bash
# update manifest.json to reflect changes
$ python3 chronicler.py
# bump major version for app
$ python3 chronicler.py -M
# bump minor version for app
$ python3 chronicler.py -m
```

## Nomenclature Explained
As you may have noticed, the URL for [willcarh.art](http://willcarh.art) is rather odd. In order to preserve my full name, Will Carhart, in the URL, I opted to use a .art [top-level domain (TLD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). Since the .art TLD is usually reserved for art portfolios, I thought it was a fitting name for my _coding portfolio._ However, the naming convention doesn't stop there! If you peruse the file structure of [willcarh.art](http://willcarh.art), you may notice that the back-end of the app is called the _easel_ while the front end of the app is called the _canvas,_ which I felt fit with the whole "art" vibe of the project ðŸ¤—
