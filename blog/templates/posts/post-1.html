		<p class="lead">I think for most people, coding can seem like a foreign language, an abstract dialect in which eclectic individuals speak to computers - and they're not entirely wrong. Taking some green text on a terminal screen and converting it to websites and mobile applications is the black magic of the modern age. And that's exactly why I love it.</p>

		<p class="lead">Writing software is one of my passions. I think it's creative, expressive, and fun. Want to make a website about <a href="https://cat-bounce.com/" target="_blank">bouncing cats?</a> Go right ahead. Want to make an iPhone app that <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/da-daily-compliment/id711717136?mt=8" target="_blank">gives you a daily compliment?</a> Be my guest. Yes, these are silly examples, but the point is writing software can be a hobby, too. And, for most developers, I think it is.</p>

		<p class="lead">I've wanted to build a personal website for a while. As much as I hate to admit it, most <i>average</i> people don't get too excited about CLIs. I'm sure every developer at some point has spent weeks on a cool command line utility, only to have the uninitiated proclaim <i>that's it?</i> So, I decided to build willcarh.art, <b>the world's greatest personal website</b>, per me. And, as an aspiring Pythonista, I wrote it in Python.</p>
