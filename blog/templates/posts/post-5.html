		<h2>Failure</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Will Carhart, and I’m a senior at USD this year, majoring in computer science. MLC has asked my to give a short talk on failure and what it means to me, and I’m super excited to speak with y’all today. I want to preface this by telling you that all of these ideas are totally my own and from my own experiences, so please don’t feel like you have follow anything I say. It is my hope, however, that you’ll connect with at least something in this short reflection and be able to keep thinking about it this weekend and throughout the semester.

Well, why listen to me? I’m not much older than many of you, and younger than a lot of you; what does a college senior know about failure? Well, for starters, I’ve failed, and I’ve failed many, many times in life. I fail often in very small ways, and I’ve had a couple of those oh shit kinds of failure in my short 21 years. I want to start with a quick story about failure in my life. Growing up, I played a lot of different sports. And when I use the word play, what I really mean is my mother signed me up for a lot of different sports, which also means I wasn’t very good at most of them. I played baseball - have you ever see Sandlot? I was uncoordinated like Smalls and pudgey and red-headed like Ham. I played lacrosse, but I was the only person in my fourth grade class to be cut from the team. I played football, but my total actual play time in games was shorter than a single half-time break; I even tried cycling for a little while, and that didn’t go well either. When I talk about these sports, it’s not that I wasn’t an athletic person, or that I didn't know how to play. It was, fairly simply, that I didn’t try, or that I didn’t care. I was okay with floating along in mediocrity, and so I failed time and time again. Part of me really didn’t like being on the bottom rung of every sports team I was on, but most of me didn’t care enough to do anything about it.
	Once I got to high school, my go-with-the-flow attitude bled into my schoolwork. I was a decently smart person, and so a lot of subjects came naturally. I was okay with what came to me with no effort. Pretty soon, however, I watched my life begin to take a different trajectory than some of my close friends. I wasn’t in the same level math class as my buddies, I got a few C’s, and I had gained weight from not being physically active. I actually had to take a few summer school classes to keep on track for graduation.
	During my sophomore year in high school, my mother signed me up for yet another sport, and this time it was rowing. You know, the one where you have to get up at 5am every day and nobody really know what is? That one. And I fricken hated it. It was super hard, nobody even knows what it is, and practice was like four hours a day. My mother told me to just try it, which was one of her infamous mandatory suggestions. And so I did. There was a two-week trial period for the team before I’d have to commit for the season. A big part of rowing is sitting on these indoor rowing machines called ergs, which are like treadmills for rowing. During those two weeks, I would stare at this little screen that told me how fast I was pulling while I rowed. And while I sat there, a few things dawned on me. One, I didn’t know anyone there, because it was a private club and not associated with my high school, and two, that I didn’t want to fail this time. I looked back at all of the different sports I’d played, the English books I hadn’t read, and the math homework I hadn’t done, and I decided during those two weeks that I didn’t want to repeat what had happened for the last twelve years of my life.
	And so I put my head down, and I worked. I only missed one practice voluntarily over the course of three years. I showed up every morning at 5am ready to work. And I started at the very bottom. Of the thirty guys on the JV team, I was by far the slowest. But failure is a long-term motivator. By the end of my senior year, I was rowing almost 15 miles a day, became the Team Captain of our varsity squad, and eventually won the Youth National Championship, becoming one of four of the fastest rowers in the country for my weight class. This helped me get recruited to row for my first two years at USD.

	But what does this have to do with failure? I don’t want this story to be a brag. The achievements I earned from rowing were largely attributed to luck, as I was very fortunate to find a team of like-minded young men in high school that enabled us to win as a team. No, I felt success, my success, was in actually trying and committing to rowing, not in winning races.
	But still, what does this have to do with failure? Well, what is failure, exactly? The first thing I think of when I think of failure is that it sucks. And not like a this isn’t fun but it’ll pass kind of way, like when you stub your toe or when you only have one item in basket at Target but the arrogant person in front of you is taking forever and yelling at the cashier. Like when you fail hard, it just sucks. You miss out on something you really wanted. You fail a test. You don’t get a job. You don’t treat a loved one respectfully, and you regret it. And no matter how you rationalize it, no matter how you think about your failure, it will always be painful in the moment. I’m sure as I’ve been listing times I’ve failed that you all are thinking of times in your life when you’ve failed. I think it’s especially hard for men because we often aren’t empowered to talk about our failures; as we mentioned last night, men are stereotypically expected to be strong and determined and not talk about their feelings when they fail. 
	I ask again, what is failure, exactly? Well, I think of failure as an uncomfortable and painful glimpse into truth and honesty about ourselves. At your lowest, at your failure, you get the clearest view into who you actually are and what reality you are living. Because when you fail, you can’t lie to yourself, and you can’t pretend you are something you are not. And, in my opinion, this is one of the reasons why failure is so painful. Because, often times we do not want to see who we really are. It is painful, but ultimately necessary, to be honest about how we’re living.
	This is not something we can do alone. I don’t think it’s possible to truly evaluate who you are during failure totally on your own. I think it is important, if not vital, to find a “support team” of people who can help you discover things about yourself that you can’t observe. When I was at my lowest in high school, I was nowhere ready to admit that I wasn't on the best path for my life. It was mother that helped illuminate this for me, something that, without her, I never would have accomplished, and thus never would have improved.
	Considering what failure can do for us, what can failure teach us about others? Well, I think failure helps us determine who are biggest allies are. Who do you turn to when you fail? Why do you turn to them when you fail? Are they good at giving you advice? Are they just a good listener? I think that failure is so unique in that it almost guides us to people in our life that we need the most. However, I also don’t think this is an easy task. I think it is failure that illuminates to us who doesn’t support us, who isn’t with us for the long-haul, through a process of painful trial-and-error. Failure teaches us with whom we want to surround ourselves, and I think it’s important, once we know that, to actively pursue and nourish relationships with people that truly care about us and who will be there for us when we inevitably fail. 
	But I think the reciprocal is also true. What about our vital support team do we cherish so much? I think that once we have failed and been treated with love and grace that we truly learn how to give love and grace. We grow as friends, as family for those that we love, because when it is time for them to fail, we know better how to give them love and grace. Therefore, I think failure is a great teacher of empathy, as well.
	Let me tell you another story about failure. I have a younger sister in high school who recently went up to Washington State to tour colleges with my dad. They got to the airport and their boarding pass said their Southwest flight was out of Gate 40, but at Gate 40 there was a Delta flight. So my dad asked one of the airport officials for help, who replied, “Well, Mr. Carhart, it says here on your boarding pass that your flight leaves at 11am from the Oakland airport,” to which my dad looked down at his watch reading 10:30am.
	“Yes, so shouldn’t we be boarding? It’s 10:30am now and the flight’s at 11am” my dad asked.
	“Yes, you should,” the attendant replied, “but this is the San Francisco airport.” They were flying out of the Oakland airport.
Long story short, they missed their flight and had to reschedule. The big thing was that my dad’s parents actually live a few hours outside Seattle, and he and my sister were flying up a day early to see them before touring colleges.
	Now, my dad made a mistake. It wasn’t a huge one, but it wasn’t necessarily trivial either. He failed, and he and my sister now didn’t have enough time to see my grandparents. So what do you think my grandparents did? Well, they hopped in the car and drove a few hours out to the Seattle airport to meet them and have dinner with them before my sister toured colleges. They didn’t tell my dad that he had failed. They didn’t criticize him or tell him what he should have done. They gave him grace. They gave him grace because they knew that he would do the same for them. And they gave him grace because that’s what they would want for themselves when they fail. I believe that they acted this way because they themselves have failed in the past, and have learned how to give genuine, authentic grace from it.
I think failure is one of the best, if not the the greatest, teachers. It’s a common cliche to say that “failure is a gift,” and there is true in that. It is often the painful gift you don’t want and didn’t know you needed. Failure can be the simple nudge to spur the momentum of motivation. It is easy to pin responsibility on others: “I’m late because traffic was bad this morning,” “I’m out of shape because the gym is too expensive,” “I failed the test because I didn’t have time to study.” All of these may be true; traffic was bad, the gym is way like $200 a month, and your roommates had people over last night so you couldn’t study, but what are YOU going to do about it next time? You failed the test because you didn’t have the time to study, so what are you going to do next time to make sure you do have the time to study. Life will see the outcome, not you excuse. Thus, failure opens a door, but YOU have to step through it. YOU have to look inside yourself, YOU have to be painfully honest to learn why YOU failed. And then YOU will have to learn from your failure to change for the future. If you do not, you will continue to make the same failure until you learn from it.
I’ll end with this: in my opinion, success alone is a false sense of security, it only makes you think that you’re a successful person. But what do truly successful people do regularly? Well, they fail. And they fail a lot. Success preceded by failure, therefore, is true achievement, because it carries the weight of all your previous blunders. Failure itself is an infinitesimally better teacher than success, because failure teaches us honesty, it teaches us empathy. And failure teaches us grace.
So as we break for lunch soon, I want to invite each of you to think about how failure has impacted your life. Who is your vital support team? Do you give others grace when they fail? What failures do you continue to make in your life, and is there something you can determine about yourself this semester to avoid making them again?
