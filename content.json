			"description": "Cheers started as a concept while I attended the University of San Diego. The goal was to develop an iOS app that would show nearby bars and restaurants with ongoing happy hours. Our team observed that often in San Diego there are many fun bars to explore, but sometimes it's hard to know where to look. That's where Cheers comes in!<br>During the project's development, we wrote a proof-of-concept iOS app, which did all processing on the client. The app uses the Yelp Fusion API to acquire its restaurant data and Firebase as a data store. Given that I had the original idea for the app and I had written more than half the code base, I decided to continue the project after my time at USD.<br>The complete version of the app is still a work in progress, but I plan on publishing it soon. The client is written entirely in Swift + iOS, while the backend is an API written in Flask and Python, using the SQLAlchemy adapter for the PostgreSQL database.",

Super exciting, right??<br>When modern applications run, they generate a plethora of logging content, and it is often cumbersome to find the small tidbit of information that's actually useful.<br>Beaver uses an English-like syntax, where the user can essentially specify <i>show me the logs from yesterday to today.</i> Beaver is smart enough to understand what the user is looking for and automatically searches for .log files in the project directory, and then prints all logs whose timestamps are between yesterday and today.<br>It's called <i>beaver</i> because beavers eat logs ðŸ˜‰",

			"description": "Locksmith acts as a liaison between precious client secrets and public version control. Locksmith uses GPG to encrypt secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.). Rather than storing plaintext passwords as hardcoded values in your code, locksmith exposes a simple API for decrypting your passwords and running your app.<br>To keep development unencumbered, locksmith only requires your password when you run your app, not every time you access a secret. In addition, tools like <i>pinentry</i> enable you to cache your password locally, so you only ever have to enter your password once, if you desire.<br>This is one of my favorite projects, I use it all over willcarh.art ðŸ¤—",
