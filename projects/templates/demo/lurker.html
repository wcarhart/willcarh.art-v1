		<h4>Simple game, complex theory</h4>
		<p class="lead">Othello's premise is very simple: take turns adding pieces to the board, and if your piece 'wraps' an enemy's piece, flip it to your color. However, the game's theory is quite complex, because often the winner of the game is only decided in the last few moves.</p>
		<p class="lead"><code>othello</code> can be played with either two players versus each other or one versus the AI player.</p>

		<h4>A case study in game theory</h4>
		<p class="lead"><code>othello</code>'s AI adversaries (<i>Euclid</i>, <i>Lovelace</i>, <i>Dijkstra</i>, and <i>Turing</i>), which are named after famous computer scientists, use knowledge of the game's theory to try to win the game. The most challenge of the AI players, <i>Turing</i>, uses concepts like <i>mobility</i> to dominate most players.</p>
