No one wants to review the results, <br>            because the amount of signal to noise is far too low. And also since it's an optional thing and not <br>            enforced by the compiler.<br><br>            I think this is where languages with stronger inbuilt analysis (e.g. Rust) win: The results are <br>            better, and since the analysis is always running as part of a compiler pass there are no huge jumps <br>            in indicated bugs at once (like what would happen if one would run Coverity on a legacy C++ <br>            codebase).<br>                <span class="teal">taeric</span> | <span class="teal">1 hour ago:</span><br>                This is less true of more advanced static analysis tools.<br>                I mean, ultimately we agree. Most people don't trust static analysis tools because they have had <br>                bad experiences with them. I just suspect most people should try them again. The state of the art <br>                is quite good in that space.<br>            <span class="teal">muglug</span> | <span class="teal">45 minutes ago:</span><br>            It sounds (from the article) like they have some sort of heuristic for determining potential <br>            severity, and they're ok with more false-positives in areas where the potential damage from a <br>            false-negative is very high.<br>                <span class="teal">m0zg</span> | <span class="teal">34 minutes ago:</span><br>                I might be biased, but I've never seen these systems work well in practice. Some 15-17 years ago <br>                Microsoft depoloyed a system called PreFix which would find genuine, hard to find bugs, but then <br>                bury them under a mountain of false positives, so few teams ran it, and even fewer looked at the <br>                results. I like what LLVM did in this area. Its SCA is not very comprehensive (so it can't be <br>                relied upon for deep analysis), but when it does find something it's usually a legit issue.<br><br>                But the balance of deep analysis and low false positives remains elusive. I'd be really stunned if <br>                FB really achieved a breakthrough in this area.<br><br>                I do want to be wrong about this.<br>                    <span class="teal">j88439h84</span> | <span class="teal">28 minutes ago:</span><br>                    In python, Pylint and mypy find real bugs all the time, plenty of false positives but still <br>                    very usable.<br>    <span class="teal">sjtindell</span> | <span class="teal">1 hour ago:</span><br>    Always cool to read about scale.</pre>

		<h4>Read summaries of news articles, so you don't have to leave the terminal</h4>
		<p class="lead">By combining with <a href="{% url 'project_detail' 'smoosh' %}"><i>Smoosh</i></a>, <code>lurker</code> can summarize the contents of articles for you.</p>
		<pre class="code">> smoosh 5<br>We use static analysis to prevent bugs that would affect our products, and we rely on our engineers' judgment as well as data from production to tell us the bugs that matter the most. While not all bugs are the same, neither are all users; therefore, we use different deployment models depending on the intended audience (that is, the people the analysis tool will be deployed to). Infer, as we will discuss, uses one analysis based on the theory of Separation Logic,16 with a novel theorem prover that implements an inference technique that guesses assumptions.5 Another Infer analysis involves recently published research results on concurrency analysis.2,10 Zoncolan implements a new modular parallel taint analysis algorithm. Back to Top Moving Fast with Infer Infer is a static analysis tool applied to Java, Objective C, and C++ code at Facebook.4 It reports errors related to memory safety, to concurrency, to security (information flow), and many more specialized errors suggested by Facebook developers. In 2017, we looked at bug fixes in several categories and found that for some (null dereferences, data races, and security issues) over 50% of the fixes were for bugs with traces that were interprocedural.a The interprocedural bugs would be missed bugs if we only deployed procedure-local analyses. Facebook has enough important code and problems that it is worthwhile to have embedded teams of analysis experts, and we have seen (for example, in the use of Infer to support multithreaded Android News Feed, and in the evolution of Zoncolan to detect SEV-worthy issues) how this can impact the company. For example, Infer is used at other companies such as Amazon, Mozilla, and Spotify; we have produced new scientific results,2,10 and proposed new scientific problems.11,14 Indeed, our impression as (former) researchers working in an engineering organization is that having science and engineering playing off one another in a tight feedback loop is possible, even advantageous, when practicing static analysis in industry.</pre>
