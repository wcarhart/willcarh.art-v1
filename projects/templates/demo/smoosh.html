Aboard Air Force One en route to Singapore, Trump tweeted, "I look forward to meeting [Kim] and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!"  Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan shared a photo that showed him welcoming Kim Jong-Un to Singapore.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information/Getty Images Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information/Getty Images  President Trump has said he will use the summit, scheduled to begin Tuesday, to push for North Korea's denuclearization. Trump and Kim Jong-Un have both suggested they could also pursue a peace treaty to officially end the Korean War, which ceased because of an armistice signed in 1953."  Hammering out a complete plan for North Korea's denuclearization would be "an impossible chore" at this summit, Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution told NPR's Windsor Johnston."  Trump arrived in Singapore after another meeting with foreign leaders -- a group of close American allies.<br><br>-_-_-_-_-_-_ METRICS _-_-_-_-_-_-<br>Original length: 3409 characters<br>Smooshed length: 1299 characters<br><br>Original smooshed by 61.89%</pre>

"As SpaceX's launch cadence and manifest for missions from Florida continues to grow, we are seeking to expand our capabilities and streamline operations to launch, land and re-fly our Falcon family of rockets," said James Gleeson, a SpaceX spokesman. Here's what SpaceX has in mind to start:  The most eye-catching feature would be a 32,000-square-foot tower standing up to 300 feet tall, housing a "world-class, architecturally distinctive" launch and landing control center.  The site would replace or add to SpaceX's current launch and landing control center, which is tucked in a small office space outside the south gate to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station near Port Canaveral.  After landing on Cape Canaveral pads or SpaceX's "drone ship" at sea, recovered Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters would return to a 133,000-square-foot hangar standing up to 100 feet tall.  Rivaling the open-air exhibit of famous spacecraft at the nearby KSC Visitor Complex, SpaceX plans to display "historic space vehicles" in its own rocket garden, potentially including Falcon boosters or Dragon capsules staged vertically or horizontally. The SpaceX Operations Area would expand the company's KSC footprint beyond the hangar it built at the base of pad 39A, which can house three Falcon boosters.<br><br>-_-_-_-_-_-_ METRICS _-_-_-_-_-_-<br>Original length: 6035 characters<br>Smooshed length: 1480 characters<br><br>Original smooshed by 75.48%</pre>
