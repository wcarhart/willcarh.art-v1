Just some notes that I think could be helpful in the future once I've forgotten how I designed this damn thing...

==========================================


1. Icons
All icons are PNG files downloaded from icons8.com with 480x480 dimensions. Each PNG uses a 50% padding so the icon is in the middle with plenty of room to zoom in. Colors are determined from icons8, but the actual icon file is downloaded with a transparent background and the color is added in with CSS later.

2. Deployment
There are three deployment environments: local, dev, and prod. Use the deploy.sh script to run the app at any of those locations.

3. Static files
There are static files littered through the project in their respective app locations. Each app folder has a 'static/' directory, as well as a static/ folder in the root directory. The 'staticfiles/' directory is created by Django at runtime for deployment. It's a little bit spaghettified!

4. Microservices
There are a few python utilities that help maintaint the site. Read about them in the README.md.

5. Database content
The database content for the Django models comes from content.json, and is loaded into the database when it needs to be updated. Use maid.py to reset the database and scribe.py to update the database.
